Pressing ctrl on tileset selection should create a seperate selection area to select/deselect tiles, rather than clicking individual ones.

If you rename a tileset for example, and try and load the resource, the resource manager doesn't realise the texture changed and doesn't re-load it. CRC32 Checksum?

Layer opacity.

History list refresh takes way too long.

Deleting a tileset should purge tiles from all open maps. Same for terrain.

Toolset Preferences

Terrain
-- Can't select terrain outside of the tileset area.
-- Cliffs should be based off column height when caching.

Santise object names so they don't fuck up windows files.

MOVE TOOL
-- Move entire layers
-- Select & move area

Only render maps in active tabs.

CANT RECREATE: Right clicking layer visibility checkbox crashes -- only when compiled?

CANT RECREATE: Various folders created in root directory sometimes?

Tile sizes?? Set them to the project instead?
